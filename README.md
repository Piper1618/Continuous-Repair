# Continuous Repair

This is a Minecraft data pack that eliminates tool and armor durability from the game.

Any items on your hotbar (including offhand slot) will be repaired continuously. Armor does not get repaired continuously because a sound effect plays any time armor durability is changed. It's normal to see armor with same damage. This doesn't mean the data pack is broken and the armor should be repaired before it breaks.

It should work in multiplayer, but may be cause lag with large numbers of players.
